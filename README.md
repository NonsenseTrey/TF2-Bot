Just a bot for Team Fortress 2, and no. This is not the annoying ahh sniper bots spamming "Join My Little Ponie fort discord UwU" in chat and killing anyone insight instantly. It walks around, and shoots from time to time saying anything.

To set up:
1, open TF2 and enter a match.
2, after entering a match open the console.
3, after opening the console, run the program and click the command input in the console quickly after running the program.
4, don't close the console (what the bot does is that it types commands into the console.
5, enjoy!

There was an older repo to this and it wasn't very professional (so I deleted it and replaced it with this one :3).
